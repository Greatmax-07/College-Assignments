Assignment 6 : Create Employee Database using Structure and Display Information
Q] Design a C program to display employee details (ID and salary) sorted by salary in descending order. 
Use arrays and structures to store the data, handle ties in salary consistently, and print the sorted list.

Our ideation as a team:
We made a program that can recommend properties to clients based on the pricing and amenities available and also allows users to add additional cost of parking. 
It then sorts them based on the total price in descending order. In case of ties, the original order is maintained. 

Challenge faced:
Maintaining the original order of properties in case of ties was a tricky task to accomplish. 

Solution:
After searching for different ways to solve such a problem, we found about bubble sort algorithm and used the same to solve this problem.
